# shopping-cart

# Repo Setup
# Use the GitHub online interface to create a new remote project repository called something like "shopping-cart". When prompted by the GitHub online interface, let's get in the habit of adding a "README.md" file and a Python-flavored ".gitignore" file (and also optionally a "LICENSE") during the repo creation process. After this process is complete, you should be able to view the repo on GitHub at an address like https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/shopping-cart.

# After creating the remote repo, use GitHub Desktop software or the command-line to download or "clone" it onto your computer. Choose a familiar download location like the Desktop.

# enter pwd in command line to ensure you are in correct dirctory

# Activate the shopping cart environment

# Use your text editor or the command-line to create a file in that repo called "shopping_cart.py", and then place the following contents inside:

# # shopping_cart.py
